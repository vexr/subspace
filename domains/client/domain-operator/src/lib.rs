//! # Domain Operator
//!
//! ## Domains
//!
//! Domains, the enshrined rollups solution of Subspace, is a configurable execution
//! framework allowing for the simple, secure and low-cost deployment of application
//! specific blockchain called domain.
//!
//! ## Operators
//!
//! In Subspace, the farmers offering the storage resources are responsible for maintaining
//! the consensus layer, operators are a separate class of contributors in the system focusing
//! on the execution layer, they provide the necessary computational resources to maintain the
//! blockchain state by running domains. Some deposits as the stake are required to be an operator.
//!
//! Specifically, operators have the responsibility of producing a [`Bundle`] which contains a
//! number of [`ExecutionReceipt`]s on each slot notified from the consensus chain. The operators
//! are primarily driven by two events from the consensus chain.
//!
//! - On each new slot, operators will attempt to solve a domain-specific bundle election
//!   challenge derived from a global randomness provided by the consensus chain. Upon finding
//!   a solution to the challenge, they will start producing a bundle: they will collect a set
//!   of extrinsics from the transaction pool which are verified to be able to cover the transaction
//!   fee. With these collected extrinsics, the bundle election solution and proper receipts, a
//!   [`Bundle`] can be constructed and then be submitted to the consensus chain. The transactions
//!   included in each bundle are uninterpretable blob from the consensus chain's perspective.
//!
//! - On each imported consensus block, operators will extract all the needed bundles from it
//!   and convert the bundles to a list of extrinsics, construct a custom [`BlockBuilder`] to
//!   build a domain block. The execution trace of all the extrinsics and hooks like
//!   `initialize_block`/`finalize_block` will be recorded during the domain block execution.
//!   Once the domain block is imported successfully, the [`ExecutionReceipt`] of this block
//!   will be generated and stored locally.
//!
//! The receipt of each domain block contains all the intermediate state roots during the block
//! execution, which will be gossiped in the domain subnet (in future). All operators whether
//! running as an authority or a full node will compute each block and generate an execution receipt
//! independently, once the execution receipt received from the network does not match the one
//! produced locally, a [`FraudProof`] will be generated and reported to the consensus chain
//! accordingly.
//!

//! [`FraudProof`]: ../sp_domains/struct.FraudProof.html
